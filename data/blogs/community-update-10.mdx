One who moves the hill sets off by taking away the rocks.

This is our 10th monthly update, and looking back at it, I can‚Äôt help feeling proud of our consistent efforts. Numerous releases, GitHub issues, sprints, and standups have brought us here. And it‚Äôs incredible to see what small teams with purpose can build with a consistent effort.



Without further ado, let‚Äôs see what our 10th edition has to offer.

## What we shipped?

The major part of our shipping code last month involved our `Traces tab`. Users can now analyze their tracing data across microservices, endpoints, HTTP methods, status codes, etc.

Latest SigNoz release<br></br>
[v0.7.1](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.7.1)

The release also comes with our updated `Trace Detail` page. Users can use the `Trace Detail` page to see how a specific event fits into the overall user request with the help of Flamegraphs and Gantt charts. The `Trace Detail` page makes it very convenient for users to visualize how the requests perform in a microservices-based application.

Let‚Äôs give you a brief walkthrough of the pages.

The `Traces` tab comes with many advanced useful filters now. Some key filters include duration, service name, status, HTTP code, host, and URL. You can utilize these filters to analyze your tracing data.

You can then run aggregates on the traces data to figure out bottlenecks.

   caption="Run aggregates like sum, avg, 50th and 90th percentiles on your tracing data"
   
/>

You can also see these aggregates in more granular detail by grouping them by service name, operation, HTTP URL, HTTP method, etc.

   caption="Group aggregates by service name, operation, HTTP URL, HTTP method etc."
   
/>

The events table lists out all the events that occurred during a given duration. If you want to drill down and see how a specific event performed as part of an entire request, you can click on it and it will take you to our new `Traces Detail` page.

   image={"/img/blog/2022/03/list_of_events.webp"}
   caption="List of events that occurred during a given duration"
   
/>

We are most excited about the new `Trace Detail` page. Using this page, our users can utilize the true power of distributed tracing. You can see how a specific event performed as part of an entire request.

The Flamegraph and the Gantt chart make it easy to deconstruct a trace into its components. Moreover, you can also see contextual data for an event with tags and events in the rightmost panel.

If you wish to check out our newest release, just follow the installation guide from our [documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/install/).

## Featured issue

[Enable S3 storage for ClickHouse](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/issues/812)

Monitoring data is often huge, and our users need solutions for long-term data retention. Our team will be working on enabling AWS S3 storage for ClickHouse, our database. This will enable our users to run SigNoz without worrying about disk usage.

If you know about other solutions for data retention or have experience working with S3, feel free to comment on this [Github issue](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/issues/812).

## What's upcoming?

### Login, Auth, and Org management

The next important feature in our product roadmap involves user login & authentication and org management. Here are some key features that our team will be working on in the upcoming sprints:

- User login with email authentication
- Invite team members to the same instance of SigNoz
- Login, password setting for team members
- Admin and guest access

This feature has been requested by a lot of our users and it will enable teams to collaborate better with SigNoz. In the long run, we want to make SigNoz a collaborative tool for engineering teams that enables them to take quick actions. And this is the first step in that direction.

### Implementing distributed tracing in a nodejs application

In modern microservices-based applications, it is difficult to understand how requests are performing across multiple services, infrastructure, and protocols. As companies began moving to distributed systems, they realized they needed a way to track requests in their entirety for debugging applications.

Distributed tracing is a technology that was born out of this need. Let‚Äôs have a brief overview of distributed tracing. Read how to implement distributed tracing in nodejs application having three microservicesüëá
