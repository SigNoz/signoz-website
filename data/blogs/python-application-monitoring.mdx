**The cost of a millisecond.**

TABB Group, a financial services industry research firm, [estimates](https://research.tabbgroup.com/report/v06-007-value-millisecond-finding-optimal-speed-trading-infrastructure) that if a broker's electronic trading platform is 5 milliseconds behind the competition, it could cost $4 million in revenue per millisecond.

The cost of latency is too high in the financial services industry, and the same is true for almost any software-based business today. For Google, half a second delay in search results caused a 20% drop in traffic. Half a second is enough to kill user satisfaction to a point where they abandon an app's service.

While a user sees a screen, there are thousands of services in the background taking care of a user's request. In a microservices architecture, the challenge for engineering teams is to constantly figure out areas of optimization in a complex distributed network. And the solution starts with setting up a robust monitoring infrastructure for the application's production environment.

Capturing and analyzing data about your production environment is critical. You need to proactively solve stability and performance issues in your web application to avoid system failures and ensure a smooth user experience.

And to do that, you need insights into how your infrastructure handles user requests. With SigNoz, you can start monitoring your app in a few simple steps, and with an easy-to-use dashboard, you can quickly identify bottlenecks in your services.

## Introducing SigNoz

SigNoz is a full-stack open-source application monitoring and observability platform which can be installed within your infra. You can track metrics like p99 latency, error rates for your services, external API calls, and individual endpoints. With service maps, you can quickly assess the health of your services.

And once you know the affected service, trace data can help you identify the exact code causing the issue. Using SigNoz dashboard, you can visualize your traces easily with flamegraphs.

Now let's get down to some action and see everything for yourself.

We have set up a [sample ToDo Python app](https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-flask-app) based on Flask web framework, which uses MongoDB as a database to demonstrate how SigNoz works. We will divide the tutorial into two parts:

1. Installing SigNoz
2. Instrumenting sample app to start monitoring


## Installing SigNoz

You can get started with SigNoz using just three commands at your terminal.

```jsx
git clone -b main https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git
cd signoz/deploy/
./install.sh
```
<br></br>

For detailed instructions, you can visit our documentation.

[![Deployment Docs](/img/blog/common/deploy_docker_documentation.webp)](https://signoz.io/docs/install/docker/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=opentelemetry_python)

When you are done installing SigNoz, you can access the UI at:Â `http://localhost:3301`

The application list shown in the dashboard is from a sample app called HOT R.O.D that comes bundled with the SigNoz installation package.

The applications shown in the dashboard are from a sample app called Hot R.O.D that comes with the installation bundle.

Now that you have SigNoz up and running, let's see how instrumentation works. Instrumentation is the process of implementing code instructions to monitor your application's performance. Instrumentation is key to see how your application handles the real world.

SigNoz supports [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) as the primary way for users to instrument their application. OpenTelemetry is a single, vendor-agnostic instrumentation library per language with support for both automatic and manual instrumentation. You don't need to worry about instrumentation in this tutorial. OpenTelemetry comes with all currently available [instrumentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python).

## Instrumenting sample app to start monitoring

**Prerequisites**

1. **Python 3.4 or newer**<br></br>
   If you do not have Python installed on your system, you can download it from the link [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Check the version of Python using `python3 --version` on your terminal to see if Python is properly installed or not.

2. **MongoDB**<br></br>
   If you already have MongoDB services running on your system, you can skip this step.
   For macOS:
   Download link: [https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)

   For Linux:
   [https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux/](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux/)


On MacOS the installation is done using Homebrew's brew package manager. Once the installation is done, don't forget to start MongoDB services using `brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community@4.4` Â on your macOS terminal.

### Steps

1. Clone sample Flask app repository<br></br>
   From your terminal use the following command to clone sample Flask app GitHub repository.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-flask-app.git
   ```

2. Update path to sample-flask-app<br></br>

   Check if the app is working or not using the following command:

   ```
   cd sample-flask-app
   python3 app.py
   ```

   ![mac terminal running Python apps](/img/blog/2021/05/screenzy-1622486361195.webp)


   You can now access the UI of the app on your local host: [http://localhost:5002/](http://localhost:5002/)

   ![sample app screenshot](/img/blog/2021/05/screenzy-1622486344949-1.webp)
   TODO reminder app with Flask and MongoDB

   Press 'Ctrl + C' to exit the app once you have made sure it is running properly.

3. **Set up OpenTelemetry Python instrumentation library**<br></br>
   Your app folder contains a file called `requirements.txt`. This file contains all the necessary commands to set up OpenTelemetry python instrumentation library. All the mandatory packages required to start the instrumentation are installed with the help of this file. Make sure your path is updated to the root directory of your sample app and run the following command:

   ```
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If it hangs while installing `grpcio` during **pip3 install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp** then follow below steps as suggested in **[this stackoverflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62500932/3243212)**

   - pip3 install --upgrade pip
   - python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools
   - pip3 install --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall -Iv grpcio

4. **Install application specific packages**<br></br>
   This step is required to install packages specific to the application. Make sure to run this command in the root directory of your installed application. This command figures out which instrumentation packages the user might want to install and installs it for them:

   ```
   opentelemetry-bootstrap --action=install
   ```

5. **Configure environment variables to run app and send data to SigNoz**<br></br>
   You're almost done. In the last step, you just need to configure a few environment variables for your OTLP exporters. Environment variables that need to be configured:

   - `service.name`- application service name (you can name it as you like)
   - `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` - In this case, IP of the machine where SigNoz is installed

   You need to put these environment variables in the below command.

   :::note
   Donâ€™t run app in reloader/hot-reload mode as it breaks instrumentation.
   :::
   
   ```jsx
   OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<service_name> OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=none OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://<IP of SigNoz>:4317" opentelemetry-instrument python3 app.py
   ```

   As we are running SigNoz on local host, `IP of SigNoz` can be replaced with `localhost` in this case. And, for `service_name` let's use `pythonApp`. Hence, the final command becomes:

   **Final Command**

   ```
   OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=pythonApp OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=none OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4317" opentelemetry-instrument python3 app.py
   ```

And, congratulations! You have instrumented your sample Python app. You can now access the SigNoz dashboard at [http://localhost:3301](http://localhost:3301/) to monitor your app for performance metrics.

## Using SigNoz dashboard to identify issues causing high latency in your app

Now that you have installed SigNoz, let's see how you can identify specific events causing high latency in your deployed applications.

In just 5 easy steps, our dashboard lets you drill down to events causing a delay in your deployed apps ðŸ‘‡

1. **Choose the service you want to inspect**

   ![List of services monitored](/img/blog/2021/06/dashboard_applications_list-2.webp)

2. **Choose the timestamp where latency is high and click on view traces**

   ![Dashboard showing RED metrics](/img/blog/2021/06/dashboard_view_traces-1.webp)

3. **Choose the trace ID with the highest latency**

   ![See list of traces](/img/blog/2021/06/dashboard_highest_traceid.webp)

4. **Inspect distributed traces with flamegraph**
