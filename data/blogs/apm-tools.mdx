Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools are a critical component of distributed applications now. But choosing the right APM tool can be tricky. In this article, we go through a list of the top 21 APM tools including open-source APM tools which can help monitor and improve your application performance.

## What is application performance monitoring(APM)?

Application performance monitoring is the process of keeping your application's health in check by tracking key performance metrics. APM tools enable you to be proactive about meeting the demands of your customers. With distributed systems, performance metrics can be gathered from various components of your application:

- Services
- Infrastructure
- Network
- Hosts and containers
- Third-party APIs
- User Interactions

Performance monitoring enables engineering and IT teams to resolve issues quickly and ensure system availability, maintain SLAs, optimize service performance and improve response times for a better user experience.

## Why are APM tools needed?

A robust APM tool can provide your engineering teams the much-needed visibility and context into the inner workings of your application. Modern distributed systems have enabled scale at a global scale but at the same time have increased the complexity of an application.

A few essential APM benefits in solving performance issues are as follows:

- Gives a **centralized context and visibility** into the app's inner workings across a distributed system
- Allows you to **proactively identify issues** that can cause breakdown and solves latency issues
- Helps you to **meet end-user expectations** and demands
- **Increase revenue** by protecting against downtime and user churn
- **Saves engineering bandwidth** in debugging and troubleshooting

Prometheus monitoring stack includes the following components:

- Prometheus server
- Client Libraries & Exporters
- Push Gateway
- Alertmanager
- Visualization Layer

The visualization layer of Prometheus is basic, but it is generally used with Grafana, a visualization tool to create charts and graphs.

### Zipkin

<a href="https://zipkin.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Zipkin</b></a> is an open-source APM tool used for distributed tracing. Zipkin captures timing
data need to troubleshoot latency problems in service architectures. In distributed
systems, it's a challenge to trace user requests across different services. If a
request fails or takes too long, distributed tracing helps to identify the events
that caused it.

Zipikin was initially developed at Twitter and drew inspiration from Google's Dapper. Unique identifiers called Trace ID are attached to each request which then identifies that request across services.

Zipkin's architecture includes:

- Reporters to send data to Zipkin
- Collectors which persist trace data to storage
- API to query data
- UI

### Graphite

<a
  href="https://graphiteapp.org/"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
  target="_blank"
><b>Graphite</b></a> is a time-series monitoring tool that was released in 2008. Graphite consists
of three software components:

- **carbon -** a service that listens for time-series data
- **whisper -** a database library for storing time-series data
- **graphite-web -** Graphite's user interface & API for rendering graphs and dashboards

The primary purpose of Graphite is to store numeric time-series data and render graphs of this data. Time-series data is a sequence of data points for a particular metric indexed over time. It can give you insights into the performance of any application, process, or service.

Graphite does not do data collection. Instead, your app needs to be configured to send data to Graphite which passively listens for data using Carbon - a Twisted daemon. Carbon then sends the data to Whisper to store the time-series data to a filesystem.

Graphite comes with an in-built UI, but that is fairly basic. Usually, for visualizations, Graphite is clubbed together with Grafana, which is an open-source visualization tool.

## How to choose the right APM tool for you?

APM tools are now a critical service for any digital business of decent size and scale. User expectations are sky-high, and a few milliseconds can cost you millions in revenue. APM tools provide engineering times the right insights to resolve issues quickly. A robust modern-day APM tool can also help engineering teams to be proactive about identifying potential bottlenecks.

In our view, APM tools should be developer-first tools. As developers directly utilize these tools in critical situations, the codebase of the tools should be open-source. Open-source is the future of all software tools.

Transparency and collaboration are some key benefits of open-source software tools. Developers want to see the code first hand, and if there are issues they want to address, they prefer to reach out to an active developer community than a customer support team.

At the same time, most open-source tools don't provide the same user experience as provided by SaaS vendors. But it doesn't have to be that way. With that objective, we created SigNoz.

SigNoz is a full-stack open-source application performance monitoring and observability tool. It provides a unified UI for both metrics and traces. Log management is also in the product roadmap and will be launched seen.
