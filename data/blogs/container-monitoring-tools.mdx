One of the easiest ways to see if the application running in our nodes is in an optimized state or not is by monitoring them. It is the last yet critical stage of any software development lifecycle. It opens up many possible improvements in your application, networking, IT automation, and other miscellaneous configurations. As we move towards microservice architecture, containerization and orchestration tools are rising.





Containers are special processes that run in isolation from other processes. As the word suggests, a container keeps the application ‘contained’ as a software package. This package includes the code, runtime dependencies, system tools and libraries, and configurations.

Most modern organizations use containers to build scalable applications.

## Top 15 Tools for Docker Container monitoring

The most fundamental way to see how your containers are performing is by running `docker stats` from your terminal. It shows metrics like these.

/>

<br></br>

These metrics might be of some use in development and debugging but are not very user-friendly for production use-case. You won’t be able to determine the root cause of failures, understand usage patterns, usage peaks, etc.

To better understand your application, you must be able to see patterns in your container performance easily. That’s where Docker container monitoring tools come into the picture.

Here’s a list of the top 15 monitoring tools that can help you monitor your container-based applications.

Here are our top choices of monitoring tools that can help you get better insights and may also help in the automation of workloads.

### SigNoz

## Final thoughts

Most traditional monitoring tools monitor infrastructure at the host level. But having insights into container performance is required to run container-based applications. Traditional monitoring tools are not suited to monitor container-based applications. 

A monitoring tool that can give you container-level insights along with capabilities to monitor performance at aggregated levels is best suited to monitor container-based applications. You can try out SigNoz to monitor your containerized application. As it is based on OpenTelemetry, you can make use of tags to see aggregated performance of containers.

## Getting started with SigNoz

It’s easy to get started with SigNoz. It can be installed on macOS or Linux computers in just three steps by using a simple installation script.

The install script automatically installs Docker Engine on Linux. However, you must manually install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on macOS before running the install script.

```bash
git clone -b main https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git
cd signoz/deploy/
./install.sh
```

You can visit our documentation for instructions on how to install SigNoz using Docker Swarm and Helm Charts.
