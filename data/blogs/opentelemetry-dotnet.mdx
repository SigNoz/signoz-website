  <title>OpenTelemetry .NET | Monitor a .NET application with OpenTelemetry & SigNoz</title>
</head>

C# (pronounced C-Sharp) is a simple, modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. <a href = "https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ASP.NET</a> is one of the top frameworks for building modern applications using C#, F#, or Visual Basic.



<a href = "https://opentelemetry.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OpenTelemetry</a> is one of the popular <a href = "https://www.cncf.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CNCF</a> projects. Some other notable projects under CNCF include Kubernetes, Helm, and Fluentd. The OpenTelemetry project aims to create an open source web standard for instrumenting cloud-native applications.

With cloud computing and containerization, there has been a rapid rise in applications with distributed systems. Distributed architectures like microservices and serverless have many benefits like on-demand scaling, but they also come with operational and troubleshooting complexities.

A robust monitoring and observability framework is needed to simplify complex cloud-native environments. One of the major challenges of setting up this framework is instrumenting a distributed application. OpenTelemetry helps solve this challenge by providing a uniform instrumentation layer. It generates three core signals from applications:

- **Traces**: Insights about the traffic across the services
- **Metrics:** Insights on performance & resource consumption
- **Logs**: How the code is executing with the help of errors/exceptions

OpenTelemetry is used to generate and collect the telemetry data(traces, metrics, and logs), but it does not provide storage and visualization of collected data. OpenTelemetry provides you the freedom to choose a backend analysis tool. And that’s where SigNoz comes into the picture.

## SigNoz & OpenTelemetry

[SigNoz](https://signoz.io) is a full-stack **open-source application monitoring and observability platform**
 which can be installed within your infra. It provides **metrics** monitoring, distributed **tracing**, **exceptions** monitoring, and custom dashboards - everything under a single pane of glass. You can also set alerts on your critical metrics to keep yourself notified.

SigNoz is built to natively support OpenTelemerty, thus making it a great choice for the OpenTelemetry backend.

Now let’s get down to see how to instrument a .NET application with OpenTelemetry and then visualize the data with SigNoz.

We will divide the tutorial into the following parts:

1. Installing SigNoz
2. Instrumenting a sample <a href = "http://ASP.NET" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ASP.NET</a>  6 MVC web app for traces
3. Instrumenting .NET application for metrics
4. Exception Logging

## Installing SigNoz

SigNoz can be installed on macOS or Linux computers in just three steps by using a simple installation script.

The install script automatically installs Docker Engine on Linux. However, on macOS, you must manually install <a href = "https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Docker Engine</a> before running the install script.

```bash
git clone -b main https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git
cd signoz/deploy/
./install.sh
```

You can visit our documentation for instructions on how to install SigNoz using Docker Swarm and Helm Charts.

[![Deployment Docs](/img/blog/common/deploy_docker_documentation.webp)](https://signoz.io/docs/install/docker/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=opentelemetry_dotnet)

When you are done installing SigNoz, you can access the UI at [http://localhost:3301](http://localhost:3301/application)

## OpenTelemetry .NET instrumentation for tracing

Step 1: Create new .NET MVC project

```bash
dotnet new mvc -n Org.MyWebApp --no-https
```

Step 2: Install OpenTelemetry Packages

```bash
cd Org.MyWebApp
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting --prerelease
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore --prerelease
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol --prerelease
```

Step 3: Configure OpenTelemetry

Note that you need to set the endpoint of SigNoz in this code snippet. If you have installed SigNoz in your local, then the endpoint is `http://localhost:4317`.

```bash
using OpenTelemetry.Resources;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;

...
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetryTracing(budiler =>
    {
        budiler
            .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation()
            .SetResourceBuilder(ResourceBuilder.CreateDefault()
                .AddService("MyWebApp")
                .AddTelemetrySdk()
            )
            .AddOtlpExporter(options =>
            {
                options.Endpoint = new Uri("http://localhost:4317"); // Signoz Endpoint
            });
    });

var app = builder.Build();
...
```

Step 4: Run the .NET app

```bash
dotnet run
```

Step 5: Monitor traces of your .NET application

Visit application `localhost:<port>/` and then visit SigNoz dashboard [http://localhost:3301/application](http://localhost:3301/trace) to see your .NET application being monitored on the SigNoz dashboard. 

Please ensure that you have generated some dummy data by calling your application’s endpoints multiple times in order to see the application on SigNoz.

/>

<br></br>

You can then visit the traces tab to see traces from your .NET application.

## OpenTelemetry .NET instrumentation for Metrics

Below are the few major types of metrics that are used commonly for application monitoring:

- **Counter**<br></br>
Instrument non-negative increments, eg: no of bytes received, no of users created.
- **Histogram**<br></br>
Instrument arbitrary values that are likely to be statistically meaningful, eg: request duration, size of response payload.
- **Gauge**<br></br>
Instrument non-additive values with time, eg: room temperature, no of running tasks.

To illustrate how to collect metrics with OpenTelemetry,  let’s create a **timed background service.**

Step: 1: Create worker app

```bash
dotnet new worker -n Org.Worker
cd Org.Worker
```

Step 2: Modify `Worker.cs`

```bash
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Diagnostics.Metrics;
namespace Org.Worker;
public class Worker : IHostedService, IDisposable
{
    private readonly ILogger<Worker> _logger;
    private Timer? _timer = null;

    public Worker(ILogger<Worker> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public Task StartAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Timed Hosted Service running.");

        _timer = new Timer(DoWork, null, TimeSpan.Zero,
            TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));   

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    private void DoWork(object? state)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Timed Hosted Service is working.");
    }

    public Task StopAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Timed Hosted Service is stopping.");

        _timer?.Change(Timeout.Infinite, 0);

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        _timer?.Dispose();
    }
}
```

Step 3: Install OpenTelemetry Packages

```bash
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting --prerelease
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol --prerelease
```

Step 4:Configure OpenTelemetry Metrics in `Program.cs`

```bash
using OpenTelemetry.Metrics;
using OpenTelemetry.Resources;
...
services.AddOpenTelemetryMetrics(options =>
{
    options
        .SetResourceBuilder(ResourceBuilder.CreateDefault()
            .AddService("Worker")
            .AddEnvironmentVariableDetector()
            .AddTelemetrySdk()
        )
        .AddOtlpExporter(options =>
        {
            options.Endpoint = new Uri("http://localhost:4317");
        });
});
...
```

Step 5: Create Meter & Counters

```bash
...
private static Counter<int> _noOfRunsCounter; 
private static Histogram<float> _timeTakenHistogram;
private static readonly Meter _baseMeter = new("WorkerMeter", "22.05");
...
public Worker(ILogger<Worker> logger)
{
...
	_noOfRunsCounter = _baseMeter.CreateCounter<int>("NoOfRuns");
	_timeTakenHistogram = _baseMeter.CreateHistogram<float>("TimeTaken", "ms");
	_baseMeter.CreateObservableGauge("ThreadCount", () => ThreadPool.ThreadCount);
...
}
```

Step 6: Update Counters

```bash
private void DoWork(object? state)
{
		// Basic Counter metric increment
    _noOfRunsCounter.Add(1);

		// Sleeping for random seconds
    _timer.Change(Timeout.Infinite, Timeout.Infinite);
    var stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew();
    var randomValue = new Random().Next(2, 10);
    Thread.Sleep(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(randomValue));
    stopwatch.Stop();

		// Recording Historgram Counter
    _timeTakenHistogram.Record(stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds);

    _logger.LogInformation($"Timed Hosted Service sleeping for {randomValue} seconds");
    _timer.Change(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));
}
```

Step 7: Visit SigNoz dashboard [http://localhost:3301/dashboard](http://localhost:3301/dashboard) and click on new Dashboard

- Set Name of the dashboard

- For Counter: Click on Add `Value` widget and enter `NoOfRuns` in PromQL query, and save the widget

- For Gauge: Now click on time-series widget, enter `ThreadCount` in PromQL query, and save the widget

- For Histogram: Click on time-series widget, enter `TimeTaken_bucket` in PromQL query, and save the widget. Other values which can be viewed `TimeTaken_sum` and `TimeTaken_count`

## OpenTelemetry .NET instrumentation for Logs

Step 1: Create .NET Core Web API

```bash
dotnet new webapi -n Org.WebAPI --no-https
cd Org.WebAPI
```

Step 2: Install OpenTelemetry Packages

```bash
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting --prerelease
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore --prerelease
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol --prerelease
```

Step 3: Configure Open Telemetry as Logging Provider

```csharp
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetryTracing(budiler =>
{
    budiler
        .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation(opt =>
        {
            opt.RecordException = true;
        })
        .SetResourceBuilder(ResourceBuilder.CreateDefault()
            .AddService("Org.WebAPI")
            .AddTelemetrySdk()
        )
        .SetErrorStatusOnException(true)
        .AddOtlpExporter(options =>
        {
            options.Endpoint = new Uri("http://localhost:4317"); // Signoz Endpoint
        });
});
```

Step 4: Let’s create a custom error in `Controllers/WeatherForcastController.cs`

```csharp
[HttpGet(Name = "GetWeatherForecast")]
public IEnumerable<WeatherForecast> Get()
{
		throw new Exception("Global Warming");
		...
}
```

Step 5: Visit [http://localhost:3301/errors](http://localhost:3301/errors) to view errors
