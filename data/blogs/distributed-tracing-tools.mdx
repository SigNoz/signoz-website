Modern digital organizations have rapidly adopted microservices-based architecture for their applications. Distributed tracing tools help monitor microservices-based applications. Choosing the right distributed tracing tool is critical. How do you know which is the right one for you? Here are the top 13 distributed tracing tools in 2022 that can solve your monitoring and observability needs.


> What is a distributed tracing tool?<br></br>
> A distributed tracing tool enables you to track user requests across multiple servers and services in a microservice architecture. It gives you a central overview of how user requests are performing in different services.

Distributed tracing tools have become a critical component in a distributed and microservices-based architecture.

So why is distributed software so popular?

There are three major reasons for the popularity of distributed software: scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

But it also comes with its own challenges. Distributed software becomes complex with scale, and no single team can fully comprehend how all services interact. Although engineering teams own single services, they become implicitly responsible for many services.

A single user request can travel through hundreds or thousands of microservices. So to quickly identify where things are going wrong, you need a central overview of how requests are performing across services.

Distributed tracing tools capture user requests as they travel through every service and measure things like latency.

A great distributed tracing tool can improve your team's response to performance issues, thereby improving the end-user experience.

Here's the list of the top 13 distributed tracing tools we will be looking at in this article:

- [SigNoz](#signoz)
- [Jaeger](#jaeger)
- [Zipkin](#zipkin)
- [Grafana Tempo](#grafana-tempo)
- [Serverless360](#serverless360)
- [Dynatrace](#dynatrace)
- [New Relic](#new-relic)
- [Honeycomb](#honeycomb)
- [Lightstep](#lightstep)
- [Instana](#instana)
- [DataDog](#datadog)
- [Elastic APM](#elastic-apm)
- [Splunk](#splunk)

Before we deep dive into each of these distributed tracing tools, let's take a short detour to understand distributed tracing.

## What is distributed tracing?
In the world of microservices, a user request travels through hundreds of services before serving a user what they need. To make a business scalable, engineering teams are responsible for particular services with no insight into how the system performs as a whole. And that's where distributed tracing comes into the picture.

<br></br>

Distributed tracing gives you insight into how a particular service is performing as part of the whole in a distributed software system. There are two essential concepts involved in distributed tracing: **Spans** and **trace context**.

**[Read our complete guide on Distributed Tracing](https://signoz.io/distributed-tracing/)**

User requests are broken down into spans.

> What are spans?<br></br>
> Spans represent a single operation within a trace. Thus, it represents work done by a single service which can be broken down further depending on the use case.

A **trace context** is passed along when requests travel between services, which tracks a user request across services. Thus, you can see how a user request performs across services and identify what exactly needs your attention without manually shifting through multiple dashboards.

## Top 13 distributed tracing tools
Now let's explore the top 13 distributed tracing tools in 2022.

### SigNoz
[SigNoz](https://signoz.io/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=article) is a full-stack open-source APM and observability tool. It captures both metrics and traces with log management currently in the product roadmap. Logs, metrics, and traces are considered to be the three pillars of observability in modern-day distributed systems.

SigNoz provides a unified UI for metrics and traces so that there is no need to switch between different tools like Jaeger and Prometheus.

Using SigNoz, you can track things like:

- User requests per second
- 50th, 90th, and 99th percentile latencies of microservices in your application
- Error rate of requests to your services
- Slow endpoints in your application
- User requests across different microservices using distributed tracing

An open-source tool with the capabilities of SaaS vendors, SigNoz is a great choice for a distributed tracing tool.

SigNoz uses OpenTelemetry for code instrumentation. OpenTelemetry provides vendor-agnostic instrumentation libraries and is quietly becoming the world standard for generating and managing telemetry data.

/>

SigNoz also provides detailed views of tracing data in the form of Flamegraphs and Gantt charts. Gantt charts make it easy to visualize your services and events in a parent-child relationship tree. You can easily figure out which events are causing latency in a request call. All of this comes out of the box with SigNoz.

## How to choose the right distributed tracing tool?

Tracing user requests is now critical for maintaining an exemplary user experience. Yes, distributed tracing directly impacts end-user experience as it gives your teams the right insights in the right amount of time to act on issues affecting application performance.

In our view, distributed tracing tools should be developer first tools. As developers directly utilize these tools in critical situations, the codebase of the tools should be open-source. Open-source is the future of all software tools.

Transparency and collaboration are some key benefits of open-source software tools. Developers want to see the code first hand, and if there are issues they want to address, they prefer to reach out to an active developer community than a customer support team.

At the same time, most open-source tools don't provide the same user experience as provided by SaaS vendors. But it doesn't have to be that way. With that objective, we created SigNoz.

SigNoz is a full-stack open-source application performance monitoring and observability tool. It provides a unified UI for both metrics and traces. Log management is also in the product roadmap and will be launched seen.

## Getting started with SigNoz

You can get started with SigNoz using just three commands at your terminal.

```jsx
git clone -b main https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git
cd signoz/deploy/
./install.sh
```
<br></br>
