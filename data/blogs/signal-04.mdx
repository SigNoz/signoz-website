Folks! Great to have you over for our monthly product update aka Signal #04. This month we made great strides in both our frontend and backend pods. Metrics ingestion, testing frameworks, improved tracking features for gRPC calls and much more!


We also crossed 200+ members on our **[slack community](https://signoz.io/slack)** ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Let's dive in to see what humans at SigNoz have been upto!

## What we shipped?

This month, we enabled metrics ingestion through SigNoz, implemented Cypress for frontend testing and you can now track erros in gRPC calls with SigNoz.

Latest Release link: [v0.3.6](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.3.6)

### Metrics Ingestion
We have enabled metrics ingestion through SigNoz. We are battle testing this for corner cases, but here's a sneak peek for you.  This was one of the most demanded features by our users and we are excited to see how the community utilizes it.

Expect a formal release in the coming weeks. If you want to beta test this feature, just write to us at hello@signoz.io.

You will be able to  track metrics like CPU load and visualize it through SigNoz. A sneak peek into our CPU load metrics charts ðŸ‘‡

### Enabled Cypress for a more robust frontend

Cypress is a Javascript-based end-to-end testing framework which can run in the browser making asynchronous testing simple and convenient. We have enabled Cypress for our front-end testing so that we can ship out error-free UIs which our users enjoy.

### Error tracking for gRPC calls

gRPC is a popular Remote Procedure Call framework used in microservices to make calls between services. We have enabled error tracking for gRPC service calls in SigNoz. Users using gRPC for communicating with services can now track gRPC calls returning error.

## Featured issue

**Enabling 1-click deploy of SigNoz on Digital Ocean**

We're striving everyday to make things easier for our users. On that front, we want to make it very simple for users to install and get started with SigNoz.

Digital Ocean is a very popular cloud infrastructure provider used by a lot of devs. We want our users to have a simple single click install experience for SigNoz on Digital Ocean. We will appreciate if any of you wants to share any inputs on the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/issues/284).


## What's upcoming?

We will be working primarily on metrics and alerts. As we have enabled metrics ingestion now, we will be testing out following metrics receivers:

- [jaegerreceiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/jaegerreceiver)
- [jmxreceiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/jmxreceiver)
- [k8sclusterreceiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/k8sclusterreceiver)
- [kafkareceiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/kafkareceiver)

You can find the complete list of receivers for which metrics ingestion pipeline will work [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver).

Alerts are a critical component for any monitoring solution. We are currently scoping out requirements for a user-friendly alert system. You can expect a beta version in the next rollout.

### ClickHouse Community Call

We joined folks at ClickHouse for their community call to showcase how we use ClickHouse for storing observability data. ClickHouse is a very fast OLAP database perfect for storing and analyzing huge amounts of telemetry data. Find some of the reasons for using ClickHouse in the picture below.

## From our blog

Are you thinking of using Jaeger as a distributed tracing tool? You might want to take some time to go through this article elaborating how SigNoz is taking distributed tracing to the next level. Not only that, SigNoz does both metrics and traces. With SigNoz, you can get a unified UI for both metrics and traces. And that is just one of the reasons to choose SigNoz over Jaeger.

Find out the entire list of reasons here ðŸ‘‡<br></br>
