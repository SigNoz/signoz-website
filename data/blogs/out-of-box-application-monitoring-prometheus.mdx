description: Prometheus is a popular monitoring tool for kubernetes. Kube-state metrics and node exporters send a lot of metrics. But visualization of the metrics in charts is still painful. In this article, let's see how we can have some out of box visualizations with Prometheus.

Prometheus is undoubtedly growing as the native monitoring tool for Kubernetes. We have been using Prometheus to collect metrics about our infrastructure for a long, but setting it of the box is still painful


Prometheus is undoubtedly growing as the native monitoring tool for Kubernetes. We have been using Prometheus to collect metrics about our infrastructure for a long time and there are plenty of dashboards available to get the dashboards up fast. For some time, I have been wondering why there aren't out of box application metrics, something like node-exporter for infrastructure metrics.

Let me explain you with an example. Installing kube-state metrics and node-exporter in your instance sends a lot of metrics about that instance to Prometheus. If the metric labels are consistent then you can get the dashboard by using publicly available Grafana dashboards, such as **[Kubernetes Capacity Planning](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/5499).**

This dashboard includes graphs for CPU usage, memory usage, disk IO, network usage, etc. Everything is ready in a few minutes.

But when we want to monitor our applications, we need to attach exporters to every application, instrument metrics which you want to monitor and build custom dashboards for it.* I was quite surprised to see the exporter metrics so limited in capacity to mostly show just RPS and Latency without proper labeling. *Comparing it to the capabilities that the monitoring tool NewRelic provides, we can see it has to go a long way.

We recently open-sourced our observability platform on Github
[ Check it here ](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz)

Hence, I built a tool to give a try to extend the APM capabilities of Prometheus. Let me begin by showing some features.

## Infra and Application Metrics from multiple clusters

We have 2 Clusters.

- the architecture of application in demo-cluster-1 is shown in image below
- demo-cluster-2 has a simple Django Application with sample endpoints

![Architecture of demo cluster](/img/blog/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-29-at-3.12.30-PM.webp)Fig 1. Architecture for Demo Cluster 1

By adding remote-write url with cluster labels you can visualise metrics from multiple Prometheus instances from different clusters. We have a running cortex at our backend that can be used for the following purposes:

1. Long term storage of Prometheus metrics
2. De-duplicating metrics for HA Prometheus setup
3. Single pane of Grafana dashboard for metrics from multiple clusters

Application metrics of Payment, Shipping and User micro-services from demo-cluster-1 and Django App from demo-cluster-2 as we can see in Fig.2 above.

Infrastructure metrics from both the clusters containing individual cluster metrics and aggregated metrics of all clusters.

## How is your application performing?

![RPS and latency metrics](/img/blog/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-29-at-3.46.38-PM.webp)Fg 3. RPS and latency metrics for application
Some cool features are:

- **_RPS by status codes_** - when you get 5xx error the graph will turn red
- **_Percentiles of requests duration_** - monitor how your 50, 90 and 99 percentiles look and get alerted when there is a sudden increase
- **_Distribution of complete application time_** - how much of time is being taken by Redis, Mongo, calls to external services, etc. This may tell you that a sudden increase in latency might be completely due to Redis and thus you should look into commands to Redis to drill down on problems.
- **_Latency by endpoints_** - you get to know which endpoints are performing slow and thus look into those specific endpoints

![Mongo and Redis - RPS and Latencies](/img/blog/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-29-at-3.54.56-PM.webp)Fig. 4 Mongo & Redis - RPS and Latencies

- Mongo/Redis specific metrics - how many calls do the application make to mongo and Redis and how does the time taken by them look
- See which type of commands/queries are taking more time

![Error report from application](/img/blog/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-29-at-4.21.21-PM.webp)Fig. 5 Error report from application

- Error percentage and RPS by status codes

![Metrics about external services](/img/blog/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-29-at-4.22.53-PM.webp)fig. 6 Metrics about external services

The payment service calls user and cart services apart from _paypal.com_. We can analyse:

- RPS of external calls by status code - now we can monitor how the calls to other micro-services are impacting this application
- Avg time taken by each of those external addresses. As we can see from the graph that calls to Paypal takes much larger time than the call to other services

![Mysql performance on application queries](/img/blog/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-29-at-4.31.15-PM.webp)Fig. 7 Mysql performance on application queries

- In Shipping App, mysql is not the bottleneck in response time. Application is taking ~1.8s whereas mysql is taking ~0.3s to respond. Thus there is scope  to improve your application logic to get better response time.
- Also, /cities API is taking ~2.5s whereas other apis like /calc, /confirm, /codes are taking ~1.5s to respond

## Is it the same as using Redis/Mysql/Mongo exporter?

No, the exporters give metrics about  Mysql/Redis/Mongo irrespective of the application. They give overall metrics and performance. What we are trying to achieve is from the application perspective. How are the Mysql/Redis/Mongo queries performing for that application? Maybe the queries from the application have high latency but the overall latency of Mysql/Redis/Mongo is well within the alert region.

## Infrastructure Metrics

![CPU and memmory usage](/img/blog/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-29-at-4.37.35-PM.webp)Fig. 8 CPU and memory usage

- In total there are 6 CPUs out of which 4.5 is idle on avg
- 1m, 5m, and 15m system load. More about load can be read [here](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_(computing)>)
- Memory usage patterns of all clusters aggregated by free, buffered and cached

![DiskIO and network usage](/img/blog/2019/11/Screenshot-2019-11-29-at-4.38.44-PM.webp)Fig. 9 DiskIO and Network usage

- Disk IO in terms of read, write and io
- Network usage of all clusters aggregated by received and transmitted bytes

We can also monitor cluster-wise metrics by choosing the cluster name from the dropdown.

> Popular USE (usage and saturation) metrics is coming up soon

## What does it take to get those metrics and build those dashboards?

We build on top of Prometheus. All these features are pluggable to already running Prometheus instances also.

### For completely new setups

1. Install signoz agent

`helm install stable/signoz-agent --name=signoz-agent --set cluster.name=demo-cluster-1 --set agent.licence=xxxxxxxxx`

2. Install Prometheus

`helm install stable/promethues --name=prom-demo` We need to set a few flags like setting external_labels cluster and replica, remote_write details:

    --set server.global.external_labels.cluster=demo-cluster-1 \
    --set server.global.external_labels.replica=two
    --set serverFiles."prometheus\.yml".remote_write[0].url=xxxxx
    --set serverFiles."prometheus\.yml".remote_write[0].basic_auth.username=x
    --set serverFiles."prometheus\.yml".remote_write[0].basic_auth.password=x

- Remote Write url will send your samples to Cortex for long term storage
- Setting flag cluster will let you aggregate metrics across clusters
- Setting flag replica will enable HA Prometheus setup and will deduplicate metrics from multiple Prometheus instances from the same cluster

3. Add **_signoz_** python package in your requirements.txt and re-build your docker image. This sensor will get your application metrics and send them to signoz-agent which shall let Prometheus scrape them

> We have separate packages for different languages and thus enabling a wide variety of technologies in Python, NodeJs, Java, etc

4.  Setup a few environment variables in  your* deployment.yaml*

            env:
              - name: NODE_IP
                valueFrom:
                  fieldRef:
                    fieldPath: status.hostIP
              - name: AUTOWRAPT_BOOTSTRAP
              	value: signoz
              - name: APP_NAME
              	value: payment

- **NODE_IP** for the sensor to communicate with the agent
- **AUTOWRAPT_BOOTSTRAP** to enable sensor
- **APP_NAME** to give a name to your application. This name will be visible in your Grafana dashboard

### For those  using Prometheus already

Skip Prometheus installation and rather only change the configuration to add remote_write urls and authentication

### For those who only want managed Prometheus long term storage

Skip all steps and change your Prometheus config to include remote_write urls and authentication

## What are the advantages over simple Prometheus?

- Managed long term storage
- Multi cluster view on a single pane of window
- Enabling HA Prometheus setup by running multiple prom instances
- Out of box application metrics
- Zero Instrumentation
- Pre-built Grafana dashboards on Infrastructure and Application metrics

> Achieving all the above in-house is work of 4-5 weeks at least
