Loki is a open source log aggregation tool developed by Grafana labs. It is inspired by Prometheus and is designed to be cost-effective and easy to operate. But Loki also has some limitations, and you might want to explore some Loki alternatives for your log analytics. In this article, we will look at 11 log management tools you can use as a Loki alternative.

Loki is designed to keep indexing low. It does this by making use of labels. Labels are any key-value pairs that can be used to describe a log stream. For example:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: system
    pipeline_stages:
    static_configs:
      - targets:
          - localhost
        labels:
          job: syslog
          __path__: /var/log/syslog
```

The above config will let you query the log stream with `{job=syslog}`. Labels act as an index to Loki's log data and keep the complexity low. But Loki does not support high cardinality. For example, if you create a label for the user's IP address, you will have thousands of log streams as every user will have a unique IP. This can make Loki very slow as it requires building a huge index.

The complete stack of Loki for log management has two other tools: Promtail for collecting logs, and Grafana for visualizing log data. Popularly, this stack is known as the PLG stack. If Loki does not suit your requirements, have a look at the top 11 Loki alternatives for log management.

## SigNoz (open source)

[SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) is a full-stack open source APM that provides log collection and analytics. SigNoz uses a columnar database ClickHouse to store logs, which is very efficient at ingesting and storing logs data. ClickHouse is designed for faster analytics with advanced querying. It supports indexing high-cardinality data, which Loki does not.

Columnar databases like ClickHouse are very effective in storing log data and making it available for analysis. Big companies like <a href = "https://www.uber.com/en-IN/blog/logging/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Uber</a> and <a href = "https://blog.cloudflare.com/log-analytics-using-clickhouse/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Cloudflare</a> have shifted to ClickHouse for log analytics.

Loki supports data in object storage, so complex aggregates are not fast enough. SigNoz stores data on disk, hence queries are faster.

SigNoz uses OpenTelemetry for instrumenting applications. OpenTelemetry, backed by CNCF, is quietly becoming the world standard for instrumenting cloud-native applications. The logs tab in SigNoz has advanced features like a log query builder, search across multiple fields, structured table view, JSON view, etc.

## Choosing the right log analytics tool

One of the most challenging parts of analyzing log data is the sheer volume of data generated. An effective log analytics tool should efficiently collect and store huge volumes of data. Once the data is collected and stored, log analysis is where tools can make a difference. Enabling users to search through logs quickly and run queries and complex aggregates to identify the root cause of issues in their application or infrastructure are critical aspects of a good log analytics tool.

While choosing a log analytics tool, a few factors should be kept in mind.

- How efficiently can the tool store logs?
- How fast you can run complex queries and aggregates?
- How easy is using the UI to analyze log data from multiple sources?
- Does the tool provide features to correlate log data with other telemetry signals like metrics and traces for deeper insights?

SigNoz supports efficient log storage, provides an intuitive UI, and lets you correlate your logs with traces and metrics for quicker analysis. As it uses a columnar database, it is also faster to run aggregates. SigNoz is also open source and can be self-hosted within your infrastructure.

## Getting started with SigNoz

SigNoz can be installed on macOS or Linux computers in just three steps by using a simple install script.

The install script automatically installs Docker Engine on Linux. However, on macOS, you must manually install <a href = "https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Docker Engine</a> before running the install script.

```bash
git clone -b main https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git
cd signoz/deploy/
./install.sh
```

You can visit our documentation for instructions on how to install SigNoz using Docker Swarm and Helm Charts.
