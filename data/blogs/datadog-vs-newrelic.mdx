Both DataDog and New Relic are enterprise monitoring tools that provide a wide range of products covering different aspects of application and infrastructure monitoring. In this article, we will compare DataDog and New Relic based on their different monitoring capabilities.




Businesses are embracing digital transformation now more than ever. In most cases, the digital channel is the primary driver of revenue and growth. Customers and end-users are going online to fulfill both their daily and long-term needs.

The digital shift has made the app production environment a critical piece of an organization's success. The performance of your application in production needs to be monitored to ensure high availability at all times.

DataDog and New Relic provide numerous products to monitor applications. Some of the key products offered by both tools include:

- Application Performance Monitoring
- Infrastructure monitoring
- Log Management
- Network monitoring
- Browser or end-user monitoring

Let's compare DataDog and New Relic based on the features they provide in the above-mentioned categories.

## Issues with existing monitoring vendors
DataDog and New Relic are great monitoring tools and provide a gamut of monitoring products that any organization can use. But these enterprise monitoring tools can have the following issues:

- Crazy node-based pricing
Node-based pricing doesn’t make sense in today’s micro-services architecture. Any node which is live for more than 8hrs in a month is charged. So, unsuitable for spiky workloads

- Very costly
 These tools are very costly if you want to do things like sending custom metrics.

- Cloud-only
Hence,  not suitable for companies that have concerns with sending data outside their infra

- Closed product roadmap
For any small feature, you are dependent on their roadmap. We think this is an unnecessary restriction for a product which developers use. A product used by developers should be extendible

The other alternative can be going for an open-source alternative. But the problem with most open-source products is that they are resource-intensive to set up, maintain and scale up. That's where [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=datadog_vs_newrelic) comes into the picture.  [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=datadog_vs_newrelic) is a full-stack open-source APM platform with easy configuration and scalable architecture.

## An alternative to DataDog and New Relic - SigNoz
[SigNoz](https://signoz.io/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=datadog_vs_newrelic) is a full-stack open-source application performance monitoring and observability tool which can be used in place of DataDog and New Relic. SigNoz is built to give SaaS like user experience combined with the perks of open-source software. Developer tools should be developer first, and SigNoz was built by developers to address the gap between SaaS vendors and open-source software.

Key architecture features:

- **Logs, Metrics, and traces under a single dashboard**<br></br>
    SigNoz provides logs, metrics, and traces all under a single dashboard. You can also correlate these telemetry signals to debug your application issues quickly. 

- **Native OpenTelemetry support**<br></br>
  SigNoz is built to support <a href = "https://opentelemetry.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" ><b>OpenTelemetry</b></a> natively, which is quietly becoming the world standard to generate and manage telemetry data.

You can also use flamegraphs to visualize spans from your trace data. All of this comes out of the box with SigNoz.

Some of the things SigNoz can help you track:

- Application overview metrics like RPS, 50th/90th/99th Percentile latencies, and Error Rate
- Slowest endpoints in your application
- See exact request trace to figure out issues in downstream services, slow DB queries, call to 3rd party services like payment gateways, etc
- Filter traces by service name, operation, latency, error, tags/annotations.
- Run aggregates on trace data
- Unified UI for both metrics and traces
- Exceptions monitoring
- Service dependency graph
- Alert setting on critical metrics
