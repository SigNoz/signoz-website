Scalability, Reliability, Maintainability...

The list goes on for the benefits of microservices architecture in today's world. But along with these benefits also comes the challenges of complexity. How do you ensure your distributed infrastructure, which spans across servers, datastores, cloud vendors, and third-party APIs, is in fine health to meet customer requirements all the time?

A single user request may get routed through three, five, eighteen, or hundred different layers of services.

And it quickly becomes unrealistic for teams to identify which service was responsible for slowing a request down. Engineering teams need a system that brings context to this complexity. A system which enables quick identification of potential issues so that it can be resolved as quickly. And that's where there is a need for a robust monitoring framework.

## Introducing SigNoz

[SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) is a full-stack **open-source application monitoring and observability platform** which can be installed within your infra. It provides metrics monitoring, distributed tracing, exceptions monitoring,and custom dashboards - everything under a single pane of glass. You can also set alerts on your critical metrics to keep yourself notified. 

You can track metrics like p99 latency, error rates for your services, external API calls, and individual endpoints. With service maps, you can quickly assess the health of your services.

Now let's get down to some action and see everything for yourself.

We will divide the tutorial into two parts:

1. Installing SigNoz
2. Instrumenting a sample Golang application to start monitoring

## Installing SigNoz

First, you need to install SigNoz so that OpenTelemetry can send the data to it.

SigNoz can be installed on macOS or Linux machines in just three steps by using a simple install script.

The install script automatically installs Docker Engine on Linux. However, on macOS, you must manually install <a href = "https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Docker Engine</a> before running the install script.

```bash
git clone -b main https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git
cd signoz/deploy/
./install.sh
```

You can visit our documentation for instructions on how to install SigNoz using Docker Swarm and Helm Charts.

[![Deployment Docs](/img/blog/common/deploy_docker_documentation.webp)](https://signoz.io/docs/install/docker/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=golang_monitoring)

When you are done installing SigNoz, you can access the UI atÂ [http://localhost:3301](http://localhost:3301/application)

The application list shown in the dashboard is from a sample app called HOT R.O.D that comes bundled with the SigNoz installation package.

<br></br>

Now that you have SigNoz up and running, let's see how instrumentation works. Instrumentation is the process of implementing code instructions to monitor your application's performance. Instrumentation is key to see how your application handles the real world. It helps you generate trace data which you can then use to understand what's happening inside your systems.

SigNoz supports [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) as the primary way for users to instrument their application. OpenTelemetry is a single, vendor-agnostic instrumentation library with support for both automatic and manual instrumentation. More details on OpenTelemetry Golang SDKs and APIs [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go).

## Instrumenting a sample Golang app

To see how SigNoz can start reporting data of a Golang app, let's see how it works with a sample bookstore app ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-golang-app)).

It is a simple bookstore app with a REST API that provides book data and performs CRUD operations. The app uses Gin framework to build a RESTful API. Gin is a high-performance HTTP web framework written in Golang containing a set of commonly used functionalities like routing, middleware support and rendering.

OpenTelemetry has specific instrumentation packages to support popular Golang packages and use cases. Â For example, this app uses the Gin framework for request routing. OpenTelemetry provides instrumentation package named **otelgin** to instrument the Gin framework which you need to import in your app. You can find the complete list of supported Golang packages [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation).

**Prerequisites**

Verify if you have Golang installed on your machine by running `$ go version` on your terminal. If you don't have Golang installed, you can download it [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).



**Step 1: Get sample Go app from GitHub**

The [sample Go app repo](https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-golang-app) contains the boilerplate code that we will instrument.

If you want to follow along with the tutorial, then you should follow the `without-instrumentation` branch.

**Step 2: Install dependencies**

Dependencies related to OpenTelemetry exporter and SDK have to be installed first. Run the belowÂ commands after navigating to the application source folder:

```go
go get go.opentelemetry.io/otel \
  go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace \
  go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk \
  go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/github.com/gin-gonic/gin/otelgin \
  go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace \
  go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracegrpc \
```

**Step 3: Declare environment variables for configuring OpenTelemetry**

Declare the following variables in `main.go` which we will use to configure OpenTelemetry:

```go
var (
	serviceName  = os.Getenv("SERVICE_NAME")
	collectorURL = os.Getenv("OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT")
	insecure     = os.Getenv("INSECURE_MODE")
)
```

**Step 4: Instrument your Go application with OpenTelemetry**

To configure your application to send data we will need a function to initialize OpenTelemetry. Add the following snippet of code in your `main.go` file.

```go
import (
  	.....

	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracegrpc"

	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/resource"
	sdktrace "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace"
)

func initTracer() func(context.Context) error {

	secureOption := otlptracegrpc.WithTLSCredentials(credentials.NewClientTLSFromCert(nil, ""))
	if len(insecure) > 0 {
		secureOption = otlptracegrpc.WithInsecure()
	}

	exporter, err := otlptrace.New(
		context.Background(),
		otlptracegrpc.NewClient(
			secureOption,
			otlptracegrpc.WithEndpoint(collectorURL),
		),
	)

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	resources, err := resource.New(
		context.Background(),
		resource.WithAttributes(
			attribute.String("service.name", serviceName),
			attribute.String("library.language", "go"),
		),
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Printf("Could not set resources: ", err)
	}

	otel.SetTracerProvider(
		sdktrace.NewTracerProvider(
            sdktrace.WithSampler(sdktrace.AlwaysSample()),
			sdktrace.WithBatcher(exporter),
			sdktrace.WithResource(resources),
		),
	)
	return exporter.Shutdown
}
```

**Step 5:  Initialize the tracer in main.go**

Modify the main function to initialise the tracer  in `main.go`

```
func main() {
	cleanup := initTracer()
	defer cleanup(context.Background())

	......
}

```

**Step 6:  Add the OpenTelemetry Gin middleware**

Configure Gin to use the middleware by adding the following lines in `main.go`.

```
import (
	....
  "go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/github.com/gin-gonic/gin/otelgin"
)

func main() {
	......
	r := gin.Default()
	r.Use(otelgin.Middleware(serviceName))
	......
}

```

**Step 7: Set environment variables and run your Go Gin application**

Now that you have instrumented your Go Gin application with OpenTelemetry, you need to set some environment variables to send data to SigNoz backend:

`SERVICE_NAME`: goGinApp (you can name it whatever you want)

`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`: localhost:4317

Since, we have installed SigNoz on our local machine, we use the above IP. If you install SigNoz on a different machine, you can update it with the relevant IP.

Hence, the final run command looks like this:

```
SERVICE_NAME=goGinApp INSECURE_MODE=true OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=localhost:4317 go run main.go
```

And, congratulations! You have instrumented your sample Golang app.

Hit theÂ `/books`Â endpoint of the bookstore app atÂ [http://localhost:8090/books](http://localhost:8090/books). Refresh it a bunch of times in order to generate load, and wait for 1-2 mins for data to appear on SigNoz dashboard.

You can now access the SigNoz dashboard at [http://localhost:3301](http://localhost:3301/) to monitor your app for performance metrics.

## Monitor your Go application with SigNoz dashboards

With the above steps, you have instrumented your Go application with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry sends the collected data to SigNoz which can be used to store it and visualize it. Letâ€™s see how SigNoz can help you monitor your Go application.

You need to interact with your sample application a bit to generate some monitoring data. As mentioned earlier, hit theÂ `/books`Â endpoint of the bookstore app atÂ [http://localhost:8090/books](http://localhost:8090/books) and refresh it a bunch of times in order to generate load.

You can then navigate to [http://localhost:3301/application](http://localhost:3301/application) (needs signup) to see your Go app being monitored.

Go toÂ `Metrics`â†’Â `goGinApp`â†’ you will be able to see the dashboard.

<br></br>

You can monitor application metrics like application latency, requests per second, error percentage, etc. with the `Metrics` tab of SigNoz.

/>

<br></br>

OpenTelemetry captures tracing data from your Gin application as well. Tracing data can help you visualize how user requests perform across services in a multi-service application.

In the `Traces` tab of SigNoz, you can analyze the tracing data using filters based on tags, status codes, service names, operations, etc.
