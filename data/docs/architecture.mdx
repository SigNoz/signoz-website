### Architecture Components

- SigNoz OpenTelemetry Collector
- ClickHouse
- Query Service
- Frontend
- Alert Manager


**OpenTelemetry Collector** can receive data in multiple formats. Here are some of the commonly used receivers:

- Jaeger Receiver
- Kafka Receiver
- OpenCensus Receiver
- OTLP Receiver
- Zipkin Receiver

One can send data from their applications directly to SigNoz Otel collector or external otel collectors can be used for collecting telemetry data & sending to SigNoz otel collector. These external otel collectors are then working effectively as an agent to collect data first and then send to SigNoz Otel collector. 


**Query Service** is the interface between Frontend and ClickHouse. It provides APIs to be consumed by frontend application and queries ClickHouse to fetch data and processes data before responding back to the frontend.

**Frontend** is the UI, built in ReactJS and Typescript and provides advanced trace/span filtering capabilities and plot metrics to provide service overviews.

**Alert Manager** evaluates different alert rules set by the users and triggers an alert if a threshold is crossed.


### Opentelemetry Introduction

SigNoz uses OpenTelemetry for instrumenting applications and for collecting telemetry data. The following docs may be useful to get familiar with the basic concepts of OpenTelemetry
