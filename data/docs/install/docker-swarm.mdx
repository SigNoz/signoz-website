This section provides information on installing SigNoz on Docker Swarm.

## Prerequisites


- A Linux or macOS machine. Microsoft Windows is not officially supported.
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). A minimum of 4GB of memory
must be allocated to each Docker node.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Git client](https://desktop.github.com/)

## Install SigNoz on Docker Swarm
    
{/* 1. <CloneRepo /> */}

2. Initialize a single-node swarm by entering the following command:
  ```bash
docker swarm init
  ```

  The output should look similar as shown below:

  ```bash
  Swarm initialized: current node (6muco3j7jjuo6k4rbiq8yr8fw) is now a manager.

  To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-6ak6diq1lbrwemx17up9c1ph039h64z0dxksjxv647qnqrd290-4tt6q22dd462p4lf2n6bqbnt4 192.168.65.3:2377

  To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
  ```

3. _(Optional)_ You can use the `docker swarm join` command to add more nodes to the swarm. Note that the node you added in the previous step is the manager. For details, see the [Docker Swarm Join](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/swarm_join/) page of the Docker documentation.

4. Deploy SigNoz by entering the `docker stack deploy command` and specifying the following:
   - `-c` and the path to the Compose file (`docker-swarm/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml`)
   - The name of the stack (`signoz`)
  ```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-swarm/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml signoz
  ```
  
  The output should look similar to the following:

  ```bash
  Creating network signoz_default
  Creating service signoz_query-service
  Creating service signoz_frontend
  Creating service signoz_otel-collector
  Creating service signoz_otel-collector-metrics
  Creating service signoz_hotrod
  Creating service signoz_load-hotrod
  Creating service signoz_clickhouse
  Creating service signoz_alertmanager
  ```

5. _(Optional)_ By default, the instructions in this document create three replicas, and each replica can handle 50K spans per second. To handle an increased load, perform the steps in the [Scale Up](/docs/operate/docker-swarm/#scale-up) section of the [Operate on Docker Swarm](/docs/operate/docker-swarm/) page.

## Verify the Installation

1. Using the `docker stack services` command, monitor the SigNoz deployment process. Wait until all SigNoz services and replicas are created:

  ```bash
docker stack services signoz
  ```

  You should see the following output:

  ```bash
  ID             NAME                            MODE         REPLICAS   IMAGE                                          PORTS

  ```
