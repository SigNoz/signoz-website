SigNoz can be installed on macOS or Linux computers, and there are two ways in which you can install SigNoz:

 - You may execute a script that checks your environment, installs Docker Engine and Docker Compose on Linux, and runs the `docker compose up` command for you. 
 - You may execute the `docker compose up` command yourself.

Both methods are provided below.

:::info
SigNoz recommends you to use the [install script](#install-signoz-using-the-install-script) on macOS and the following Linux distributions:
  - Ubuntu
  - Debian
  - OpenSuse
  - CentOS
  - SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)

If you're using a different Linux distribution, see the [Install SigNoz Using Docker Compose](#install-signoz-using-docker-compose) section.
:::

## Prerequisites

- A Linux or macOS machine. Microsoft Windows is not officially supported.
- On macOS, you must manually install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
before you run the install script. The install script automatically installs Docker Engine on Linux.
- A minimum of 4GB of memory must be allocated to Docker.
- [Git client](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Ensure that the ports `3301`, `4317` and `4318` are open on the machine where you install SigNoz.


## Install SigNoz Using the Install Script

1. <CloneRepo />

2. Run the `install.sh` script:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

## Install SigNoz Using Docker Compose

:::info
Before you install Signoz, ensure that [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is installed on your machine.
:::

1. <CloneRepo />

2. To install SigNoz, enter the `docker-compose up` command, specifying the following:
    - `-f` and the path to your configuration file
    - `-d` to run containers in the background

  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml up -d
  ```

## Verify the Installation

1. Ensure that your containers are running correctly. To view the status of your containers, run the following command:

```bash
docker ps
```
  The output should look similar to the following:

```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                    PORTS                                                                            NAMES

```

2. Wait for all the pods to be in running state, and then point your browser to `http://<IP-ADDRESS>:3301/` to access the dashboard, replacing `<IP-ADDRESS>` with the IP address of the machine where you installed SigNoz.

  **Example**:
    - If you're running SigNoz on your local machine, you should point your browser to `http://localhost:3301/`.
    - If the IP address of the machine on which you're running SigNoz is `66.82.18.247`, you should point your browser to `http://66.82.18.247:3301/`


:::info
The `docker-compose.yaml` installs a sample application named [HotR.O.D](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/tree/master/examples/hotrod) that generates tracing data. You can explore the SigNoz dashboard with the data provided by the sample application. If you wish to remove the sample application, follow the steps in the [Remove the Sample Application](/docs/operate/docker-standalone/#remove-the-sample-application) section.
