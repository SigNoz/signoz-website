# Migration Guides

The following sections provide instructions to migrate SigNoz components across newer versions. You need to run these migration scripts step by step. For example if you are currently on `0.8.2` and want to migrate to `0.10.0` - you need to run migration script for `0.9` first and then `0.10`
