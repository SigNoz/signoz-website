# Upgrade to 0.10 from earlier versions

v0.10 is a breaking release which requires data migration for errors and exceptions section, if you are upgrading from an older version then you have to run the data migration scripts to be able to see past errors and exceptions data.

## First upgrade to 0.10

Follow the platform specific instructions to upgrade to 0.10 and above.

Note that the past exceptions/error data will not be visible on the new application until you run the migration script.

- [Docker Standalone](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/docker-standalone/#upgrade)
- [Docker Swarm](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/docker-swarm/#upgrade)
- [Kubernetes](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/kubernetes/#upgrade)

## Steps to run migration script:

### Docker

```bash
docker run --name signoz-migrate --network clickhouse-setup_default \
  -it -d signoz/migrate:0.10 -host=clickhouse -port=9000
```

Steps to check logs:

```bash
docker logs -f signoz-migrate
```

In case of failure and have to run again, make sure to cleanup the container before running the migration script again.

```bash
docker stop signoz-migrate

docker rm signoz-migrate
```

### Docker Swarm

For Swarm, you could follow similar step to that of [Docker](#docker). However,
you would need to expose clickhouse container ports to host machine and use
host machine IP i.e. `172.17.0.17` for `-host` flag instead of `clickhouse`.

If you do not want to change anything in the current signoz deployment or to
expose clickhouse ports even temporarily, you can go through following steps.

1. To download `migration-v0.10` binary:

  ```bash
  wget https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz-db-migrations/releases/download/v0.10/migration-v0.10-linux-amd64

  chmod +x migration-v0.10-linux-amd64
  ```

2. To copy the binary in persistent volume path `/var/lib/clickhouse` in `clickhouse` container:

  ```bash
  docker cp migration-v0.10-linux-amd64 $(docker ps -q -f name=signoz_clickhouse):/var/lib/clickhouse/migration-0.10
  ```

3. To exec into the `clickhouse` container:

  ```bash
  docker exec -it $(docker ps -q -f name=signoz_clickhouse) bash
  ```

4. Now, change directory to the `/var/lib/clickhouse` and run the migration script:

  ```bash
  cd /var/lib/clickhouse

  ./migration-0.10
  ```

  You should see output similar to this:
  ```
  127.0.0.1 9000 default 
  No TTL found, skipping TTL migration
  There are total 1 rows, starting migration... 

  Processing 1 rows of serviceName flaskApp

  _________**********************************_________ 
  Completed migration in:  14.299842ms
  Dropping signoz_error_index table
  Successfully dropped signoz_error_index
  ```

5. At last, clean up the binary:

  ```bash
  rm migration-0.10
  ```

### Kubernetes

```bash
kubectl -n platform run -i -t signoz-migrate --image=signoz/migrate:0.10 --restart='Never' \
  -- -host=my-release-clickhouse -port=9000 -userName=admin -password=27ff0399-0d3a-4bd8-919d-17c2181e6fb9
```

Steps to check logs:

```bash
kubectl -n platform logs -f signoz-migrate
```

In case of failure and have to run again, make sure to cleanup the pod before running the migration script again.

```bash
kubectl -n platform delete pod signoz-migrate
```

## In case of failure

1. Note the `ServiceName: xxxxx` and `TimeNano: xxxxx` in the logs of the migration script
2. Check the recommneded batch size section at the end of this page and use a runtime flag if needed
3. Re-run migration command using flags `service` and `timeNano` and `batchSize` with values from above as mentioned in the `CLI Flags` section below
4. Reach out to us at [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/signoz-community/shared_invite/zt-lrjknbbp-J_mI13rlw8pGF4EWBnorJA)

## CLI Flags

There are some custom flags which can be enabled based on different usecases.
All the flags below are `optional`.

Flags:

- `-port` : Specify port of clickhouse. `default=9000`
- `-host` : Specify host of clickhouse. `default=127.0.0.1`
- `-userName` : Specify user name of clickhouse. `default=default`
- `-password` : Specify password of clickhouse. `default=""`
- `-dropOldTable` : If it is set to true then the old tables will be dropped after data migration is successful `default=true`
- `-service` : If you want to restart the migration starting with the service after it has failed specify the service name with -service. `default=""`
- `-timeNano` : Timestamp in nano after which the migration needs to be restarted. `default=""`
- `-batchSize` : Batch size of the reading/writing to clickhouse as part of migration. `default="70000"`

:::info
**Recommended batch size:** Larger batch size leads to faster migration. But large batch size requires more memory. On average 1 row takes around 1.5 KBytes uncompressed data. So 70,000 rows uses around ~105 MBytes of data storage. So if you are migrating large data then you should use a larger batch size based on available memory on clickhouse and migration pods.
Average row size varies for each system, so you should check the average row size of your system and use a proper batch size.
To get the average row size of your table, you can use the following command after [connecting to clickhouse](https://signoz.io/docs/operate/clickhouse/connect-to-clickhouse/):

``` sql
SELECT
    database,
    table,
    formatReadableSize(sum(data_uncompressed_bytes) AS usize) AS uncompressed, 
    sum(rows) AS total_rows,
    formatReadableSize(usize/sum(rows)) AS avg_rows_size
FROM system.parts
WHERE (active = 1) AND (database LIKE 'signoz_traces') AND (table LIKE 'signoz_error_index')
GROUP BY
    database,
    table;
```
