# Upgrade to 0.8.0 from earlier versions

v0.8.0 is a breaking release which requires data migration, if you are upgrading from an older version then you have to run the data migration scripts to be able to see past data.

## First upgrade to 0.8.0

Follow the platform specific instructions to upgrade to 0.8.0 and above.

Note that the past data will not be visible on the new application until you run the migration script.

### Docker

- `git clone -b main https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git && cd signoz/deploy/`
- `git checkout v0.8.0`
- `./install.sh`

### Kubernetes

- `helm repo update`
- `helm search repo signoz --versions`
- `helm -n platform upgrade my-release signoz/signoz`

## Steps to run migration script:

### Docker

```bash
docker run --name signoz-migrate --network clickhouse-setup_default \
  -it -d signoz/migrate:0.8 -host=clickhouse -port=9000
```

Steps to check logs:

```bash
docker logs -f signoz-migrate
```

In case of failure and have to run again, make sure to cleanup the container before running the migration script again.

```bash
docker stop signoz-migrate

docker rm signoz-migrate
```

### Kubernetes

```bash
kubectl -n platform run -i -t signoz-migrate --image=signoz/migrate:0.8 --restart='Never' \
  -- -host=my-release-clickhouse -port=9000 -userName=admin -password=27ff0399-0d3a-4bd8-919d-17c2181e6fb9
```

Steps to check logs:

```bash
kubectl -n platform logs -f signoz-migrate
```

In case of failure and have to run again, make sure to cleanup the pod before running the migration script again.

```bash
kubectl -n platform delete pod signoz-migrate
```
