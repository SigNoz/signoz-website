# Increase the ClickHouse Persistent Volume Size

You can use the following `helm upgrade` command to increase the size
of the persistent volume used by SigNoz.

Replace the following values to match your environment:

- Your namespace (this example uses `platform`)
- Your release (this example uses `my-release`)
- Your chart (this example uses `signoz/signoz`)
- The new size of the persistent volume (this example uses `25Gi`)

## Check if Volume Expansion is Allowed

Before you proceed, run the following command to check if
your storage class allows volume expansion:

```bash
kubectl get storageclass -o json | jq '.items[]|.metadata.name + ": " + (.allowVolumeExpansion|tostring)'
```

Output should be similar as below:
```
"standard: false"
"standard-resizable: true"
```

If the storage class used by SigNoz cluster PVCs returns `true`, that means
you can directly proceed with [increase persistent volume section](#increase-persisent-volume).

If `false`, proceed with any of the following relevent section:
- [AWS - EKS](#eks---amazon-web-service-aws)
- [GCP - GKE](#gke---google-cloud-platform-gcp)
- [Other Platform](#other-kubernetes-cloud-platform-and-bare-metal-servers)

:::info
If you are unsure about storage class used by SigNoz Cluster PVC,
run the command below:

```bash
kubectl get -n platform pvc
```
:::

## Increase Persistent Volume

You should be able to increase clickhouse persistent volume size easily with
the following, if you have SigNoz cluster with expandable storage class.

```bash
helm -n platform upgrade my-release signoz/signoz \
  --set clickhouse.persistence.size=25Gi
```

```
Note:
To override values in a Helm chart, you can also use the `values`/`-f` flag. See the [Helm Upgrade](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/) page of the Helm documentation for more details.

## EKS - Amazon Web Service (AWS)

:::info
For setting up kubernetes cluster in AWS, refer to
[AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).
:::

You can follow the [increase persistent volume section](#increase-persisent-volume)
if you had started the SigNoz cluster with expandable storage class as mentioned below:

```bash
helm -n platform install my-release signoz/signoz \
   --set clickhouse.installCustomStorageClass=true \
   --set clickhouse.cloud=aws \
   --set clickhouse.persistence.storageClass=gp2-resizable
```

If you had started with default configurations, you would have to follow the steps below:

1. You would have to edit default storage class i.e. `gp2`
and patch the `allowVolumeExpansion` to `true`.

```bash
kubectl patch storageclass gp2 -p '{"allowVolumeExpansion": true}'
```

Output:
```
storageclass.storage.k8s.io/gp2 patched
```

2. Run helm upgrade command:

```bash
helm -n platform upgrade my-release signoz/signoz \
  --set clickhouse.persistence.size=25Gi
```

3. (Optional) After the size change reflects in few minutes, you could edit
the default storage class `gp2` back to its previous state.

## GKE - Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

:::info
For setting up kubernetes cluster in GCP, refer to
[Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/).
:::

You can follow the [increase persistent volume section](#increase-persisent-volume)
if you had started the SigNoz cluster with expandable storage class as mentioned below:

```bash
helm -n platform install my-release signoz/signoz \
   --set clickhouse.installCustomStorageClass=true \
   --set clickhouse.cloud=gcp \
   --set clickhouse.persistence.storageClass=gce-resizable
```

If you had started with default configurations, you would have to follow the steps below:

1. You would have to edit default storage class i.e. `pd-standard`,
and patch the `allowVolumeExpansion` to `true`.

```bash
kubectl patch storageclass pd-standard -p '{"allowVolumeExpansion": true}'
```

Output:
```
storageclass.storage.k8s.io/pd-standard patched
```

2. Now, run helm upgrade command:

```bash
helm -n platform upgrade my-release signoz/signoz \
  --set clickhouse.persistence.size=25Gi
```

3. (Optional) After the size change reflects in few minutes, you could edit
the default storage class `pd-standard` back to its previous state.

## Other Kubernetes Cloud Platform and Bare-Metal Servers

:::info
For setting up kubernetes cluster in other cloud platform or bare-metal servers, refer
to [Kubernetes Getting Started Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/).
:::

You can follow the [increase persistent volume section](#increase-persisent-volume)
if you had started the SigNoz cluster with expandable storage class - let's say
`custom-resizable-storage-class` as mentioned below:

```bash
helm -n platform install my-release signoz/signoz \
   --set clickhouse.persistence.storageClass=custom-resizable-storage-class
```

If you had started with default configurations, you would have to follow the steps below:

1. You would have to edit default storage class i.e. `standard` in case
of [kind cluster](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) - it could be different in
your scenerio, and patch the `allowVolumeExpansion` to `true`.

```bash
DEFAULT_STORAGE_CLASS=$(kubectl get storageclass -o=jsonpath='{.items[?(@.metadata.annotations.storageclass\.kubernetes\.io/is-default-class=="true")].metadata.name}')

kubectl patch storageclass "$DEFAULT_STORAGE_CLASS" -p '{"allowVolumeExpansion": true}'
```

Output should be similar to the following:
```
storageclass.storage.k8s.io/standard patched
```

2. Run helm upgrade command:

```bash
helm -n platform upgrade my-release signoz/signoz \
  --set clickhouse.persistence.size=25Gi
```

3. (Optional) After the size change reflects in few minutes, you could edit
the default storage class `standard` - or some other storage class as per your
previous output, back to its previous state.
