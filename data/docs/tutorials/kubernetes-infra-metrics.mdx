### Overview
To export K8s metrics, you can enable different receivers in OpenTelemetry
collector which will send metrics about your Kubernetes infrastructure
to SigNoz. These OpenTelemetry collectors will act as agents which send
metrics about K8s to SigNoz.

Based on where you are running SigNoz ( e.g. in an independent VM or K8s cluster),
you have to provide the address to send data from the above receivers.

### Steps to export K8s metrics to SigNoz

1. **Clone Otel collector repo**

   ```jsx
   git clone https://github.com/SigNoz/otel-collector-k8s.git && cd otel-collector-k8s
   ```

2. **Set up the address to SigNoz in your OTel collectors**<br></br>
   You need to set up the address to SigNoz in your OTel collector which
   is collecting the K8s metrics.

   a. If you are running SigNoz in an independent VM, you need to change the placeholder
   IPs in the following files with the IP of machine where you are hosting signoz.
   
   -  [agent/infra-metrics.yaml][1]
   -  [deployment/all-in-one.yaml][2]

   You need to update the below section.
   
   ```jsx
   exporters:
      otlp:
        endpoint: "<IP of machine hosting SigNoz>:4317"
        tls:
          insecure: true
   ```

   b. If you are running SigNoz in the same Kubernetes cluster where your applications
   are, you have to replace the above endpoint in [agent/infra-metrics.yaml][1] and
   [deployment/all-in-one.yaml][2] by

   ```jsx
   <helm_release_name>-signoz-otel-collector.<namespace_hosting_signoz>.svc.cluster.local:4317
   ```

3. **Install OTel collectors and enable specific receivers to send metrics to SigNoz**
   
   To access metrics from kubeletstats receivers you have to:

   ```jsx
   kubectl create ns signoz-infra-metrics
   kubectl -n signoz-infra-metrics apply -Rf agent
   kubectl -n signoz-infra-metrics apply -Rf deployment
   kubectl -n signoz-infra-metrics get pods
   ```

   [List of metrics from Kubernetes receiver][3].

4. **Plot Metrics in SigNoz UI**

   To plot these metrics, follow the instructions given in the docs [here][4].

5. **Import Dashboard with CPU and Memory Metrics**

   You can import basic dashboard with CPU and Memory metrics of K8s cluster
   containers from [here][5].

   After importing, you can include more widgets using other metrics from
   the [list below][3].

6. **Generate and Import Dashboard with Node Metrics**
   
   To generate node metrics dashboards for each nodes of K8s cluster:

   ```bash
   for node in $(kubectl get nodes -o name | sed -e "s/^node\///");
   do
   curl -sL https://github.com/SigNoz/benchmark/raw/main/dashboards/hostmetrics/hostmetrics-import.sh \
      | HOSTNAME="$node" DASHBOARD_TITLE="Node Metrics Dashboard for $node" bash
   done
   ```

   After importing the generated dashboards, you can include more widgets as
   per you need using metrics from the [list below][3].
