description: View MongoDB metrics in SigNoz

This tutorial shows you how you can visualise MongoDB metrics in SigNoz. We take an example of a FastAPI sample app which uses MongoDB to walk through this tutorial. 

Based on how you are using MongoDB, your exact steps may be different - but this should give you an idea of how to go about it.

### Install FastAPI sample app via docker

1. Clone this sample [FastAPI application](https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-fastapi-with-dbs#run-using-docker-compose)

Follow instructions in the README file to set up the application. Please ensure to point the FastAPI application to IP of the machine where SigNoz is installed

2. Use `172.17.0.1` - if running SigNoz also in same VM as the FastAPI application

```java
http://172.17.0.1:4317
```


This comes with Mongo Exporter built in which exposes metrics in prometheus format at port 9216

### Check that MongoDB metrics are exposed at following end point

```java
curl http://localhost:9216/metrics
```

### Update Otel Collector config file to scrape MongoDb metrics

Add a job name corresponding to mongodb exporter in otel-collector-metrics config file in your SigNoz install

[signoz/otel-collector-metrics-config.yaml](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/blob/e3c4bfce528eec2e5a6441608165baf9e1b46388/deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup/otel-collector-metrics-config.yaml#L11)

```java
- job_name: "mongo-collector"
          scrape_interval: 30s
          static_configs:
            - targets: ["172.17.0.1:9216"]
```

Job names should be aligned

Please ensure that the edited YAML is correctly configured. You can use tools like [http://www.yamllint.com/](http://www.yamllint.com/) to check the correctness of the updated YAML file

Make changes in otel-collector-metrics file 

### Restart Otel Collector metrics container

`docker-compose --env-file ./docker/clickhouse-setup/env/x86_64.env -f docker/clickhouse-setup/docker-compose.yaml restart otel-collector-metrics`

check that otel-collector-metrics is running by doing

```java
sudo docker ps
```

## Plotting Mongo metrics in SigNoz

[Good guide on metrics you may want to monitor](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/how-to-monitor-mongodb-and-what-metrics-to-monitor)

Create new panels in [Dashboard section](/docs/userguide/manage-dashboards-and-panels) of SigNoz and add the following queries for example. 

```java
PromQL query - mongodb_ss_connections
Legend Format - {{conn_type}}

PromQL query - rate(mongodb_ss_opcounters[5m])
Legend Format - {{legacy_op_type}}
```

You can use queries from the json files here to plot more metrics.
