# S3 Integration With AWS IAM role in EKS

### Overview
In SigNoz, we can configure retention period of traces and metrics separately.
We can also set the duration after which the data will be moved to cold storage
(S3) for both traces and metrics.


In AWS eks we can integrate the S3 cold storage in two ways.
1. Using AWS access and secret keys.
2. Using AWS IAM Role.

### Using AWS Access and Secret Keys

Instruction to set retention period with cold storage (S3) can be found
in the [rention period userguide](https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/retention-period/).

### Using AWS IAM Role

To use AWS role to configure S3 cloud storage in SigNoz we need to add
the role arn in the helm **overwrite-values.yaml** and run the helm upgrade.

```yaml
clickhouse:
   cloud: aws
   # Cold storage configuration
   coldStorage:
      enabled: true
      defaultKeepFreeSpaceBytes: "10485760"
      endpoint: https://<AWS S3 DNS URL>/data/
      role:
         enabled: true
         annotations:
            eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::*********:role/********
```

However, just adding the AWS role arn will not complete the integration,
because here we need to associate the given IAM role with a Kubernetes
service account named: `clickhouse-instance`.

Following are the steps that we need to perform step by step to
complete this association of AWS Role ARN with AWS EKS service
account named clickhouse-instance.

For this, we will configure AWS EKS, OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider,
IAM Roles and service accounts.

1. Go to EKS cluster and copy the OIDC provider URL.(inside green rectangle)
   
   ![AWS OIDC URL](/img/docs/s3-cold-storage/aws-eks-oidc-url.png)

2. Go to AWS IAM and check if there are any IAM OIDC providers in AWS
   IAM for the given _"CLUSTER"_.

3. If there are no IAM OIDC providers for the given _"CLUSTER"_, then create an IAM OIDC provider.
   Below are the steps to create an IAM OIDC provider:

   a. Go to IAM --> Click on the Identity Provider --> Click On Add provider.
   ![IAM OIDC PROVIDER](/img/docs/s3-cold-storage/aws-iam-oidc-provider.png)

   b. Choose **openid connect** --> Copy EKS OIDC url into **Provider URL** and
   click on *Get Thumbprint** --> Enter **sts.amazonaws.com** into the **Audience**
   text box --> click on **Add Provider**.
   ![ADD OIDC PROVIDER](/img/docs/s3-cold-storage/add-iam-oidc-provider.png)

4. Create AWS S3 bucket for SigNoz cold storage.

   a. Go to AWS S3 console --> click on the **Create bucket**.
   ![AWS S3](/img/docs/s3-cold-storage/aws-s3-create.png)

   b. Fill all the details like bucket name **(demo-cold-storage)**, choose
   region and create the bucket. You can refer the
   [AWS Userguide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html)
   for more details.

5. Create an IAM S3 policy. This policy will be attached to the IAM role.
   Below are the IAM policy details.

   Let us assume you create a S3 with the name **demo-cold-storage**.
   ```json
   {
      "Statement": [
         {
               "Action": [
                  "s3:GetObject",
                  "s3:GetObjectVersion",
                  "s3:PutBucketVersioning",
                  "s3:PutObject"
               ],
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Resource": [
                  "arn:aws:s3:::demo-cold-storage",
                  "arn:aws:s3:::demo-cold-storage/*"
               ]
         }
      ],
      "Version": "2012-10-17"
   }
   ```
6. Create an IAM role for SigNoz service accounts: `clickhouse-instance`.

   a. Go to AWS IAM --> Roles --> Create Role.
   ![AWS IAM ROLE](/img/docs/s3-cold-storage/aws-iam-role.png)

   b. Choose **web identity** --> Select the above created OIDC provider
   from Identity provider drop down ---> Choose **sts.amazonaws.com**
   from audience drop down --> Click on Next.
   ![AWS WEB IDENTITY](/img/docs/s3-cold-storage/aws-web-identity.png)

   c. Choose the IAM S3 policy created above and click on the next button.
   ![AWS IAM POLICY](/img/docs/s3-cold-storage/aws-iam-policy.png)

   d. Enter the role name **demo-cold-storage-role**, description and tags and create the role.
   ![AWS ADD ROLE](/img/docs/s3-cold-storage/aws-add-role.png)

7. Update the `overwrite-values.yaml` with relevent bucket name and IAM role annotation.

```yaml
clickhouse:
   cloud: aws
   # Cold storage configuration
   coldStorage:
      enabled: true
      defaultKeepFreeSpaceBytes: "10485760"
      endpoint: https://demo-cold-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/data/
      role:
         enabled: true
         annotations:
            eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn:arn:aws:iam::1234056789:role/demo-cold-storage-role
```
8. Upgrade the helm deployment.

```bash
helm --namespace platform upgrade my-release signoz/signoz -f overwrite-values.yaml    
```
