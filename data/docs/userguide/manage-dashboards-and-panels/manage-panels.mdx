# Manage Panels

This section shows how you can create, update, and remove a panel.

## Prerequisites

- This section assumes that your application is already instrumented. For details about how you can instrument your application, see the [Instrument Your Application](/docs/instrumentation/) section.
- This section assumes that you are familiar with the basics of monitoring applications.


## Add a Panel to a Dashboard

SigNoz supports two types of panels: time series, which displays a metric over a time interval, and value, which displays only the most recent value. To add a panel to a dashboard, follow the steps below:

- From the sidebar, choose **Dashboards**.
- Find the dashboard to which you want to add a new panel.
- Select **Add Panel**.
- Select either **Time Series** or **Value**.
- Populate the following fields:
    - **Panel Title**: Enter a descriptive name for your panel.
    - **Description**: Enter a brief and meaningful description of your new panel.
    - _(Optional)_ **Panel Time Preference**: You can use the the drop-down list to specify the time range for which you want to view data. The time range you specify here overrides the global value.
    - _(Optional)_ **Y Axis Unit**: Specify the unit of measurement for the y-axis.
- To specify the data displayed on your panel, you can use:
    - The query builder. The query builder provides an easy-to-use graphical interface that allows you create custom queries. For instructions, see the [Create a Custom Query](/docs/userguide/create-a-custom-query) page.
    - The declarative query language based on SQL that ClickHouse supports. For details, see the [SQL Reference](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/) page of the ClickHouse documentation.
    - PromQL. For details see the [Prometheus Querying Language](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) page of the Prometheus documentation.
- _(Optional)_ If you’re using the query builder, you can also transform your data by adding mathematical functions. For example, you can divide the value that a query returns by a number. The following mathematical functions are supported: *exp*, *log*, *ln*, *exp2*, *log2*, *exp10*, *log10*, *sqrt*, *cbrt*, *erf*, *erfc*, *lgamma*, *tgamma*, *sin*, *cos*, *tan*, *asin*, *acos*, *atan*, *degrees*, *radians.*
- _(Optional)_ You can plot up to ten queries on the same panel. To plot a new query, select the **+ Query** button.
-  When you’ve finished, select the **Save** button.

Note the following about panels:
- The total number of queries and functions you can plot on a single panel must be less or equal to ten.
- Every time you add or modify a function or formula, you must select the **Stage & Run Query** button. If you do not select this button, the panel will not be updated and your changes will be lost whenever you move to a different tab. When you have unsaved changes, the system will display an orange circle next to the name of the tab that you've modified:

- You can hide or unhide a function or formula by selecting the eye icon at its left and then selecting the **Stage & Run Query** button.
- When you install SigNoz, only the data provided by the Hostmetric receiver is available. To enable more metric receivers, see the [Send Metrics to SigNoz](/docs/userguide/send-metrics) section.

## Update a Panel

- From the sidebar, choose **Dashboard**.
- Find the dashboard in which you created the panel you wish to update, and then select the pencil icon located at the top right corner of your panel.
- Make the changes.
- When you’ve finished, select the **Save** button.
