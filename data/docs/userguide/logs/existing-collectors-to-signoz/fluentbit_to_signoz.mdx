# FluentBit to SigNoz

If you use fluentBit to collect logs in your stack with this tutotrial you will be able to send logs from fluentBit to SigNoz.

At SigNoz we use opentelemetry collector to recieve logs which supports the fluentforward protocol. So you can forward your logs from your fluentBit agent to opentelemetry collector using fluentforward protocol.

## Steps:
* Add fluentforward reciever to your `otel-collector-config.yaml` which is present inside `deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup`
    ```
    receivers:
      fluentforward:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:24224
    ```
    Here we have used port 24224 for listing in fluentforward protocol, but you can change it to a port you want.
    You can read more about fluentforward receiver [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/fluentforwardreceiver).

* Update the pipleline for logs by making the following change in `otel-collector-config.yaml`
    ```
    service:
      ...

      logs:
        receivers: [ otlp, fluentforward ]
        processors: [ batch ]
        exporters: [  clickhouselogsexporter ]
    ```
    Here we are updating the logs pipeline which will collect logs from `fluentforward` and `otlp` receiver, processing it using batch processor and export it to clickhouse.

* Change the fluentBit config to forward the logs to otel collector.
    ```
    [INPUT]
      Name   dummy
      Tag    dummy.log
      Dummy {"message": "mylog", "trace_id": "0000000000000000f4dbb3edd765f620", "span_id": "43222c2d51a7abe3"}

    [OUTPUT]
      Name          forward
      Match         *
      Host          otel-collector-host
      Port          24224
    ```
    In this example we are generating sample logs and then forwarding them to the otel collector which is listening on  port 24224.
    `otel-collector-host` has to be replaced by the host where otel-collector is running. For more info check [troubleshooting](../install/troubleshooting.md#signoz-otel-collector-address-grid). 
*  Once you make this changes you can restart fluentBit and SignNoz, and you will be able to see the logs in SigNoz.
*  To properly transform your existing log model into opentelemetry [log](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/logs/data-model.md) model you can use the different processors provided by opentelemetry. [link](./logs.md#processors-available-for-processing-logs)
  
    eg:- 
    ```
    processors:
      logstransform:
        operators:
          - type: trace_parser
            trace_id:
              parse_from: attributes.trace_id
            span_id:
              parse_from: attributes.span_id
          - type: remove
            field: attributes.trace_id
          - type: remove
            field: attributes.span_id
    ```
    The operations in the above processor will parse the trace_id and span_id from log to opentelemetry log model and remove them from attributes.
