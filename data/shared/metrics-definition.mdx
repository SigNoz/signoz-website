Application metrics represent a characteristic of your application as a value at a specific point in time. For example, an application metric is the number of requests per second your application serves. SigNoz collects information as a sequence of data points every minute and then represents the data through time in a graphical form. The X-axis is time, and the Y-axis is the value.
